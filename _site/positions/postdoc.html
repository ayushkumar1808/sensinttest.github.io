          <h1>3 Post-Doc Positions in HCI at Saarland U and Max Planck Institute</h1>
<br>
We have 3 openings for postdoctoral researchers at the HCI Lab at Saarland University (http://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de)
and the newly established Sensorimotor Interaction Group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics
(http://www.paulstrohmeier.info/). Both labs are co-located at Saarland Informatics Campus in Saarbrücken, Germany.
<br><br>
We are searching for curious and inquisitive minds who want to conduct cutting-edge research and push the boundaries of
HCI in one or multiple of the following areas:
<br><br>
<b>Research Area 1:</b> Haptic Feedback, Perception, Graphics, and VR
We conduct research towards better understanding how to use alternative sensory modalities. This includes making virtual
worlds more immersive through touch interactions with virtual objects, presenting information through alternative
channels including EMS and tactile cues, and modifying our body experience, for example to create the illusion of
movement, even where there is none.
<br><br>
<i>Some of our previous work in this area:</i>
<li>bARefoot (UIST2020) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3379337.3415828</li>
<li>Magnetips (CHI 2019) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300638</li>
<li>Tacttoo (UIST 2018) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242587.3242645</li>

<br><br>
<b>Research Area 2:</b> Wearable and body-based interaction, devices, or robots
We investigate how bodies can be used for interaction by designing novel technologies which are either wearable or which
directly connect to the body. Research questions include the design of novel technologies and input methods for on-skin
interaction, as well as technologies which extend human abilities through robotic appendages or EMS intervention.
<br><br>
<i>Some of our previous work in this area:</i>
<li>SkinMarks (CHI 2017) https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025704</li>
<li>iSkin (CHI 2015 Best Paper Award) http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2702391</li>
<li>More than touch (CHI 2014) http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557239</li>

<br><br>
<b>Research Area 3:</b> Fabrication, new materials, or soft robotics
To integrate interaction anywhere and in any form, we design novel fabrication methods, materials and actuation methods
for embedding input, output and behavior into everyday materials. We investigate how novel printing, knitting, weaving,
casting, or dying methods can be used to create multi-material structures which can sense their environment, communicate
to users, or even display independent behaviors.
<br><br>
<i>Some of our previous work in this area:</i>
<li>Polysense (CHI 2020) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376841</li>
<li>PrintScreen (UIST 2014 Best Paper Award): http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2647413</li>
<li>HotFlex (CHI 2016): http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858191</li>
<br><br>
The HCI Lab at Saarland University, led by Jürgen Steimle, specializes in developing novel interaction techniques,
interactive devices, rapid fabrication, and sensing methods in the fields of mobile, embedded, and wearable computing.
The Sensorimotor Interaction Group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, led by Paul Strohmeier, investigates
novel ways of perceiving virtual worlds, how to augment and extend our perception, and how to closely integrate digital
systems with our body. We have a strong presence at CHI and UIST and ongoing collaborations with major international
institutes. The groups share the same lab space and collaborate closely.

<br><br><br>
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<br>
A successful candidate has:
<li>a PhD degree in Computer Science, Information Science, Human-Computer Interaction, or other field related to our
  research areas (or will obtain the PhD in the near future)</li>
<li>an outstanding track record of publications in high-quality venues related to human-computer interaction or
  equivalent</li>
<li>creativity, independence</li>
<li>excellent team working and communication skills, and high motivation for research at the intersection of HCI and new
  technologies</li>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Position</h3>
<br>
We offer post-doc positions for initially two years, with the option to extend by another year. Salaries are
internationally competitive, based on state employees salary scheme TV-L E 13 or E 14, and include health insurance and
social insurance. The start date is flexible, but fall 2021 is preferred.
<br><br>
Your role will involve the design, prototyping, and evaluation of new interactive technology and user interfaces, as
well as writing up the results for academic publication. You will contribute to the leadership of ongoing projects
(e.g., within the ERC Grant InteractiveSkin) while also initiating new ones based on your unique background and
expertise. You will also have the opportunity to supervise graduate and undergraduate students and (moderately)
contribute to the teaching activities of the lab. The position is well suited for high impact publications.
<br><br><br>
<h3>About Saarbrücken</h3>
<br>
Saarbruecken can count itself amongst the leading locations for computer science research in Europe. Five co-located CS
research institutes with a global reputation form Saarland Informatics Campus (SIC): Saarland University with three
associated departments, the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the
German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), the Center for Bioinformatics and the Cluster of Excellence
on Multimodal Computing and Interaction, overall with around 800 researchers in Computer Science. You can find more
information on http://saarland-informatics-campus.de/.
<br><br>
Saarbrücken is a mid-sized thriving student city in the Saarland Region of Germany. It is home to a charming 18th
century downtown area, with a plethora of outdoor places for having a drink and enjoying both traditional Saarlandian
cuisine, and food from all over the world. Its location right at the border to France and close to Luxembourg guarantees
a vibrant, interesting mix of cultures. The campus is located within woodland parks and can be easily reached by bicycle
from all residential areas (in fact, all commutes in the city can be done by bicycle). It is well connected to both
Paris and Frankfurt via high-speed trains. Feel free to get in touch regarding questions about life in Saarbrücken.
<br><br><br>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>
<br>
We start reviewing applications on June 30th 2021. Applications will be considered until the positions are filled.
Please submit your CV, your research statement, a full list of publications, copies of university degree(s) and/or study
transcripts, names and contact information of three references, and PDFs of three selected publications. In your cover
letter, indicate clearly which research area you wish to contribute to.
<br><br>
Please send your application via e-mail to Mona Linn, sek-hci@cs.uni-saarland.de. Should you have questions about the
position, please do not hesitate to contact us, Paul Strohmeier and Jürgen Steimle, directly.
<br><br>
To ensure equity and diversity, applications from women and minority genders as well as from groups of people
underrepresented in science (e.g. researchers who are marginalized due to disabilities, ethnicity or cultural
background, sexuality, migration experience, first generation, etc.) are especially welcome.
