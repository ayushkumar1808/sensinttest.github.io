  - title: Multiple Openings
    content: |
        The Sensorimotor Interaction Group [1] has several open positions, including Postdocs, PhD Students, and Research Engineers.
        We are a small diverse team of HCI researchers interested in cognition and sensorimotor systems, engineering, music, and philosophy. We publish at top-tier HCI venues like CHI and UIST, as well as more specialized conferences such as TEI and AHs. We are also starting to branch out to venues like SIGGRAPH and IEEE World Haptics.
        
        We design systems to better understand sensorimotor processes and apply this understanding to create new systems. So far, our focus has been on haptics, with explorations into agency, wearable systems, and music. 

        We are specifically looking to hire in three areas
        
        <b>#1 Kinesthetic Displays </b>
        We are exploring the design of kinesthetic experiences using vibrotactile feedback. Building on our previous research in tactile rendering, we aim to create systems that allow users to perceive movements without actively performing them. This project is supported by a 1.5 million Euro European Research Council Starting Grant (ERC StrG). We are seeking researchers with expertise in areas such as (vibro)tactile feedback, human physiology and movement, sensory illusions and multisensory integration, motion tracking, VR/AR systems, and wearable on-body systems design.
        This work will build on
        Haptic Servos (CHI’23) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580716
        Motionless Movement (CHI’24) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642499
        vARitouch (CHI’24) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642828


        <b>#2 Wearables for Music Modulation & Agency Explorations</b>
        We are interested in designing wearables for interacting with music and media in collaborative group settings. Our interests are threefold. First, we research the seamless design of wearable technology, from soft sensor development to ensuring functionality and wearability. Second, we explore how to design complex systems that enhance users' sense of agency. Finally we are interested in using GenAI for synthesizing physiological data, and expanding the efficacy of human actions. This project is in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning artist Imogen Heap and her design team. We seek researchers with expertise in sensor design, audio synthesis, machine learning, longitudinal data modeling, cognitive models of agency, and fashion & design.
        This work will build on
        RaveNET (TEI’24) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3635270
        Singing Knit (AHs’22) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3519391.3519412
        Who Did It? (UIST’24) - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3654777.3676335


        <b>#3 Commercialization of Research Prototypes</b>
        We aim to make our research more accessible to the public by distributing it through a start-up closely connected to our group. Our goal is to refine our research prototypes to ensure they are robust and ready for public use. In doing so, we intend to explore additional avenues to create a lasting impact with our work. We are looking for researchers and engineers interested in product-oriented research and design, with strong expertise in embedded systems and analog electronics.

        This work will initially expand on Haptic Servos (CHI’23)- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580716


  - title: Before Applying

        Please review our past research and identify where it aligns with your interests. Reach out to group members to learn if our working culture fits yours. Feel free to message us with questions.

  
  - title: Application Process
    content: |
      Applications for PostDoc will be reviewed on a rolling basis until a suitable candidate is found. Feel free to send a quick informal e-mail as early as possible, so we know who is interested. We would then let you know if we think you’d generally be a good fit and whether we are still searching, before you put the work in to put together a full application.

      For all applications, please include what you believe is most relevant for us to make an informed decision. PhD applications must include a transcript of their Msc Diploma and Grades. PostDoc applications must include a list of publications or link to google scholar. A research statement and a description of supervision experiences are encouraged. Letters of recommendation or endorsement from researchers we personally know or with good scientific standing are valuable. PhD Students and PostDocs will be hired according to the German state employees salary scheme TV-L E 13 or E 14, and include health insurance and social insurance. 

      Please send your applications to paul[dot]strohmeier[at]mpi-inf[dot]mpg[dot]de

    content: |
     The Sensorimotor Interaction group is led by Paul Strohmeier. The group is co-located with Saarland  University’s <a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/"> HCI Lab</a>, run by Jürgen Steimle. Both groups collaborate tightly and share lab-spaces. The group is also part of the Computer Graphics department of the <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-graphics">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a>, led by Hans-Peter Seidel. Within the Max Planck Institute, the group also collaborates with Vahid Babei’s <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=home">AIDAM</a> group and the <a href="https://sampling.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ ">Sampling and Rendering</a> group lead by Gurprit Sing.

  - title: Saarbrücken
    content: |
     Saarbruecken is one of the leading locations for computer science research in Europe. Five co-located CS research institutes with a global reputation form <a href="http://saarland-informatics-campus.de/">Saarland Informatics Campus (SIC)</a>: Saarland University with three associated departments, the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), the Center for Bioinformatics and the Cluster of Excellence on Multimodal Computing and Interaction, overall with around 800 researchers in Computer Science.

     Saarbrücken itself is a mid-sized thriving student city in the Saarland Region of Germany. It is home to a charming 18th century downtown area, with a plethora of outdoor places for having a drink and enjoying both traditional Saarlandian cuisine, and food from all over the world. Its location right at the border to France and close to Luxembourg guarantees a vibrant, interesting mix of cultures. The campus is located within woodland parks and can be easily reached by bicycle from all residential areas (in fact, all commutes in the city can be done by bicycle).  It is well connected to both Paris and Frankfurt via high-speed trains. Feel free to get in touch regarding questions about life in Saarbrücken.
