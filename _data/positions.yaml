  - title: Multiple Openings
    content: |
        The Sensorimotor Interaction Group has several open positions. We are hiring Postdocs, PhD Students, and Research Engineers. We intend to fill four positions in total.
        
        We are a small diverse team of HCI researchers interested in cognition and sensorimotor systems, engineering, music, and philosophy. We publish at top-tier HCI venues like CHI and UIST, as well as more specialized conferences such as TEI and AHs. We are also starting to branch out to venues like SIGGRAPH and IEEE World Haptics.
        
        We design systems to better understand sensorimotor processes and apply this understanding to create new systems. So far, our focus has been on haptics, with explorations into agency, wearable systems, and music. 

        We are specifically looking to hire in three areas
        
        <b>#1 Kinesthetic Displays </b>
        We are exploring the design of kinesthetic experiences using vibrotactile feedback. Building on our previous research in tactile rendering, we aim to create systems that allow users to perceive movements without actively performing them. This project is supported by a 1.5 million Euro European Research Council Starting Grant (ERC StrG). We are seeking researchers with expertise in areas such as (vibro)tactile feedback, human physiology and movement, sensory illusions and multisensory integration, motion tracking, VR/AR systems, and wearable on-body systems design.
        
        This work will build on         <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580716">Haptic Servos (CHI’23)</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642499">Motionless Movement (CHI’24)</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642828">vARitouch (CHI’24)</a>.


        <b>#2 Wearables for Music Modulation & Agency Explorations</b>
        We are interested in designing wearables for interacting with music and media in collaborative group settings. Our interests are threefold. First, we research the seamless design of wearable technology, from soft sensor development to ensuring functionality and wearability. Second, we explore how to design complex systems that enhance users' sense of agency. Finally we are interested in using GenAI for synthesizing physiological data, and expanding the efficacy of human actions. This project is in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning artist Imogen Heap and her design team. We seek researchers with expertise in sensor design, audio synthesis, machine learning, longitudinal data modeling, cognitive models of agency, and fashion & design.
        
        This work will build on         <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3635270">RaveNET (TEI’24)</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3519391.3519412">Singing Knit (AHs’22)</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3654777.3676335">Who Did It? (UIST’24)</a>.


        <b>#3 Commercialization of Research Prototypes</b>
        We aim to make our research more accessible to the public by distributing it through a start-up closely connected to our group. Our goal is to refine our research prototypes to ensure they are robust and ready for public use. In doing so, we intend to explore additional avenues to create a lasting impact with our work. We are looking for researchers and engineers interested in product-oriented research and design, with strong expertise in embedded systems and analog electronics.

        This work will initially expand on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580716">Haptic Servos (CHI’23)</a>.

  - title: Requirements for PhD Students
    content: |
        Ideal PhD candidates will have a strong academic track record and a completed degree in computer science*. They should demonstrate their ability to document and complete projects (e.g., through portfolios, research papers, artwork, products, concepts, or designs). Strong applied technical skills in at least one area relevant to the projects (e.g.: data analysis, costume design, software development, electronics, embedded systems, machine learning, audio design, etc.) are required.  Candidates should be able to work independently while coordinating within a larger team.
        
        PhD Students will receive a three year contract. The salary is internationally competitive, based on state employees salary scheme TV-L E 13 and includes health insurance and social insurance.

        *Candidates without a degree in computer science are welcome but may need to complete extra coursework during the course of their PhD, according to the regulations of the Graduate School of Saarland University.
        
  - title: Requirements for Postdocs
