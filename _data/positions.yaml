description: We are currently searching for a PostDoc to start as soon as possible, and have opportunities for PhD students starting throughout the course of the year.

positions:
  - title: Prospective PhDs &amp; Postdocs

      We are searching for someone with
      - Strong writing and argumentation skills
      - Strong methodological skills (these might be qualitative or quantitative methods)
      - Experience in publishing at international scientific venues
      Your specific research background is less important, as long as the work we are doing excites you. 
      As our research group primarily targets Human Computer Interaction (HCI) venues, an HCI background would be a natural fit. 
      However, a researcher with a background in Computer Graphics (in particular Sampling and Motion Reconstruction are themes we are interested in) would help further deepen internal collaborations with other MPI-INF members. 
      Mechanical Engineers or Perceptual Psychologists or Psychophysics researchers would broaden our expertise in areas relevant to our core research interests. 
      Designers and Textile Engineers would support us in deploying our work and designing wearable devices. 
      As a successful PostDoc in the Sensorimotor Interaction Group you would further develop your own research and portfolio. You would support the other group-members and thesis students in their projects. You would co-shape the overall strategy and direction of the group.
