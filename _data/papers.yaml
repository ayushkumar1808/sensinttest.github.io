    year: 2022
    authors: <b>Courtney N. Reed</b>, Sophie Skach, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>, and Andrew P. McPherson
    venue: Augmented Humans (AHs)
    description: With friends from QMUL, we build a knit wearable collar, Singing Knit, to implement vocal EMG in a context-specific, wearability- and implementation-oriented device. The collar uses a knit body and fabric electrodes in place of a rigid multi-electrode setup. We introduce new ways to adapt multi-electrode systems.

    authors: <b>Dennis Wittchen</b>, Katta Spiel, Bruno Fruchard, Donald Degraen, Oliver Schneider, Georg Freitag, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b> 
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI '22)
    description: The TactJam workshop we held at last year’s TEI was a full success. As the workshop was super interesting, the organizers and some participants came together to write up our observations as well as present the system. The contribution is not only a proven system for tactile design, but also reflections on how the tools we use shape the design outcomes.

    authors: <b>Courtney N. Reed</b>
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI '22)
    description: Courtney presented a synopsis of her PhD work at the TEI graduate consortium. The paper outlined studies in musical imagery and perception of the voice and body during singing practice, how EMG can be used to augment the vocalist-voice relationship, and studies exploring sensory experience with sonified EMG signals.

    year: 2021
    authors: Jarrod Knibbe, Rachel Freire, Marion Koelle, and <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI '21)
    description: Jarrod and I built a multi-electron sleeve for his research into EMS stimulation. We then invited Rachel Freire to join us in designing an updated version of that sleeve. This paper discusses this process and uses this to discuss the general concept of wearability. It was ages in the making. as Jarrod said "... and all it took was three weeks of writing -- and three years of talking about what to write".

    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)

    year: 2021
    authors: Bruno Fruchard, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>, Roland Bennewitz, and Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: This project developed from our interest in designing pressure input on the skin. We performed multiple experiments to better understand the overal space of providing pressure input on soft surfaces. One thing we noted is that our study setup generally produced much better results than the literature previously suggested. I advised on study design, and contributed to data analysis, framing and writing of the paper.

    authors: Narjes Pourjafarian, Marion Koelle, Bruno Fruchard, Sahar Mavali, Konstantin Klamka, Daniel Groeger, Paul Strohmeier, and Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: Here we present a concept and prototype implementation of concurrent, computer-supported sketching and implementing of epidermal devices. In many ways this was one of the most complex systems I've ever worked on, as the interplay between all the elements from new materials (the gold ink we used and the various substrate options we worked with) to hacked sensing devices (the on-skin Anoto tracking) to mechanical engineering (the modified dual-purpose pen) turned out much more complex than anyone anticipated. My involvement included the evaluation (together with a large chunk of work which we ended up removing from the paper, hopefully to be published inthe future), conceptualization, framing and writing and simply making sure we don't get lost in the details.

    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Seref Gu¨ngo¨r, Luis Herres, Dennis Gudea, Bruno Fruchard, and Jürgen Steimle.
    venue: User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '20)
    description: This paper essentially implements the hypothetical system described in the 'practical implications' section of my thesis. I had lots of help on the hardware and example applications by some very talented students. Bruno designed the experiments together with me and implemented them. This paper is essentially a logical consequence of my 'Generating Haptic Textures' and 'Mid-Air Haptic Textures' papers.

    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier , Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'18)
    description: In this paper we explore rendering textures in 3D space. As our feedback system does not provide the counter-force one experiences when interacting with a surface texture, it is not clear how such mid-air textures might be perceived. We present a qualitative analysis of the experience of interacting with mid-air textures, and how input parameters influence this experience.

    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jarrod Knibbe, Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI)
    description: Touch input on clothing is difficult as there are ample opportunities for unintentional activation. In this paper we present a simple fabric design that acts as both a resistive and a capacitive sensor. We present instructions on how to build it and we demonstrate that the resulting hybrid sensor is more robust than either resistive- or capacitive-only equivalents and that the additional information improves the detection of custom gestures.

    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2017
    description: When we move our finger over a material, the structure of the fingertip and the structure of the material interact – they generate vibration. These vibrations are experienced as textures. In this paper we explore how properties of such vibrations map to experiences of texture.

    image_outline: true
    year: 2011
    authors: Frederike Kaltheuner, Paul Strohmeier
    venue: Maastricht Journal of Liberal Arts
    description: Frederike and I wrote this essay to point out that the model of distributive justice used by Shelley Kagan is based on a set of normative assumptions. It is therefore only ‘intuitive’ to people who share his assumptions. We demonstrate how his model would change if the initial assumptions change.

    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jesse Burstyn, JP Carrascal, Vincent Levesque Roel Vertegaal
    venue: International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI) 2016
    description: We presented the first fully functional, wireless flexible phone. In cooperation with Immersion we augmented the phone with a haptic actuator. This allows us to change how the material properties of the phone are experienced. We conducted studies investigating bend-input mappings to haptic feedback styles.

    year: 2016
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Juan Pablo Carrascal, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA)
    description: While on-body interaction is treated as a novel concept in HCI, we point out that it is not necessarily the case. One way in which on-body interaction is quite common is the habit of doodling or writing notes on one’s arm. We presented a survey that explores this practice, in hope that it may serve as inspiration for future HCI explorations.
