  The <a href="http://sensint.org">Sensorimotor Interaction</a> group (senSInt) is a newly formed research group at the <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a> (MPI-INF). The group is led by <a href="http://fkeel.github.io">Paul Strohmeier</a>, we conduct research into human perception and computer sensing to improve Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Our research topics include Tactile Rendering, Sensorimotor Augmentation, and On-Body Systems.

  The Sensorimotor Interaction Group is co-located with the <a href="http://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de">Human Computer Interaction Lab</a> of Saarland University.
